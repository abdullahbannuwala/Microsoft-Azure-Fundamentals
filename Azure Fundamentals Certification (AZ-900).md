2. Storage : Virutal hard driver
3. Networking : Virtual Networking
4. Databases : Virtual Database

# What is Microsoft and Azure?

2. Global : Anywhere in the world
3. Secure : Cloud services can by secure by default.
4. Reliable : Data Backup + Disaster recovery + data replication + fault tolerance
5. Scalable : increase / descrease  + services based on demand
6. Elastic : Automate scaling / Drop in demand
7. Current The underlying hardware and software is upgrade or replace by provider withour interruption to you.

# Types of Cloud Computing
1. SaaS : Software as a Service : run & manage by provider. like Saleforce + Gmail + Office 365 : For Customers
2. PaaS : Platform as a Service : Focus on the deployment & Managment of apps. like AWS + Heroku + Google App Engine : For Developers.
3. IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service :  Basic building block of cloud IT + Provide access to networking feature computer + storage like Azure + AWS + Oracle Cloud : For Admins
