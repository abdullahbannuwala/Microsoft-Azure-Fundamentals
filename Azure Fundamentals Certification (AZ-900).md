# What is Cloud Computing?
1. Using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, mangage and process data rather then a local server or personal computer.
2. On-Premise : Buy own server + Hire IT Persons + pay or rent the real-estate + take all risk.
3. Cloud Provicer : Someone else do all the above things you need just to configure cloud services & code. 
4. Dedicated Server : One Physical Mechine + Single Business + Very Expensive + High Maintanance + High Security.
5. Virtual Private Server : One Physical Mechine + Single Business + Virtualized in-to sub-mechines + Run multiple apps.
6. Shared Hosting : One Physical Mechine + Multipe Business + Very Cheap + Very Limited.
7. Cloud Hosting : Multiple Physical Mechine at as one system + Abstracted by multiple cloud services + Flexible + Scalable + Secure + Cost Effective + High Configurability

# Common Cloud Services
 Hundreds of cloud services.

# IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service: 4 most common type
1. Computer: Virtual Computer that can run the app, program + code
2. Storage: Virtual hard driver
3. Networking: Virtual Networking
4. Databases: Virtual Database

# What is Microsoft and Azure?
1. Azure: Microsoft Cloud Service Provider OR CSPs
2. The Bright Blue Color of the cloudless sky

# Benefits of Cloud Computing?
1. Cost Effective: pay for what you consume + no up-front cost + Pay as you go + Thousand of users sharing the cost of the resource.
2. Global: Anywhere in the world
3. Secure: Cloud services can be secure by default.
4. Reliable : Data Backup + Disaster recovery + data replication + fault tolerance
5. Scalable: increase/decrease  + services based on demand
6. Elastic: Automate scaling / Drop in demand
7. Current The underlying hardware and software are upgraded or replaced by the provider without interruption to you.

# Types of Cloud Computing
1. SaaS: Software as a Service: run & managed by provider. like Salesforce + Gmail + Office 365: For Customers
2. PaaS: Platform as a Service: Focus on the deployment & management of apps. like AWS + Heroku + Google App Engine: For Developers.
3. IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service:  The basic building block of cloud IT + Provide access to networking feature computer + storage like Azure + AWS + Oracle Cloud: For Admins

# Cloud Deployment Models
1. Public Cloud: Everything is built on the cloud provider  + Cloud Native + Everything runs on Azure.
2. Private Cloud: Everything is built on the company data center + On-Premise + The cloud could be OpenStack.
3. Hybrid: On-Premise & Cloud Service Provider
4. Cross Cloud : Multiple Cloud Provider

# Cloud Architecture Terminologies
1. Availability: Remains available
2. Scalability: Grow Rapidly 
3. Elasticity: Shrik & grow to meet the demand
4. Fault Tolerance: Prevent a failure
5. Disaster Recovery OR Highly Durable: Recover from a failure

# Global Infrastructure

# Regions and Geographies
1. Region: is a grouping of multiple data centers (Availability Zone) + 58 Regions across 140 Countries.
2. Geography: Discreet market of two or more regions that preserves data residency & compliance boundaries.
3. Azure Geographies: USA + Azure Government US + Canada + Brazil + Mexico .i.e you want to guarantee that data will remain within Canada.

# Paired Regions
1- One region is paired with another region 300 miles away.
2- Only one region is updated at a time.
3- Some Azure Services rely on paired regions for disaster recovery.
4- GRS (azure geo-redundant storage) automatically replicates data to a secondary region.
5- Example : Canada + Canada Central + Canada East

# Region Types and Service Availability OR Availability  Options
1. Not all Azure services are available in every region
2. Recommended regions: provide the broadest range of services and design to support the Availability Zone 
3. Alternate regions: a region that extends its footprint within a data residency boundary where recommended regions also exist + do Not support Availability Zone + label as "Other" in Azure portal.
4. General Availability: Service is publicly available to everyone.
 
1.  3 Catagories
2.  Foundational: Available immediately or in 12 months in recommended + alternate region in GA.
3.  MainStream: Available immediately or in 12 months in recommended regions + maybe available in alternate regions on customer demand.
4.  Specialized: Available in recommended or alternate regions based on customer demand.

# Availability Zones
1. AZ: Physical Location with one or more data centers.
2. DataCenter: Secured that contains hundreds of thousands of computers. 
3. Region: Generally contains 3 AZ + data centers within the region that are isolated from each other in different buildings but they will close enough to avoid latency.
4. For high availability we run workload in at least 3  AZs.
