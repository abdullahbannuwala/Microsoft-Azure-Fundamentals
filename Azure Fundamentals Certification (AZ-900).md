## Cloud Concept 

# What is Cloud Computing?
1. Using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, mangage and process data rather then a local server or personal computer.
2. On-Premise : Buy own server + Hire IT Persons + pay or rent the real-estate + take all risk.
3. Cloud Provicer : Someone else do all the above things you need just to configure cloud services & code. 
4. Dedicated Server : One Physical Mechine + Single Business + Very Expensive + High Maintanance + High Security.
5. Virtual Private Server : One Physical Mechine + Single Business + Virtualized in-to sub-mechines + Run multiple apps.
6. Shared Hosting : One Physical Mechine + Multipe Business + Very Cheap + Very Limited.
7. Cloud Hosting : Multiple Physical Mechine at as one system + Abstracted by multiple cloud services + Flexible + Scalable + Secure + Cost Effective + High Configurability

# Common Cloud Services
1. Hundreds of cloud servies.

# IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service : 4 most common type
1. Computer : Virutal Computer that can run app, program + code
2. Storage : Virutal hard driver
3. Networking : Virtual Networking
4. Databases : Virtual Database

# What is Microsoft and Azure?
1. Azure : Microsoft Cloud Service Provider OR CSPs
2. Bright Blue Color of the cloudless sky

# Benefits of Cloud Computing?
1. Cost Effective : pay for what you consume + no up-front cost + Pay as you go + Thousand of users sharing the cost of the resource.
2. Global : Anywhere in the world
3. Secure : Cloud services can by secure by default.
4. Reliable : Data Backup + Disaster recovery + data replication + fault tolerance
5. Scalable : increase / descrease  + services based on demand
6. Elastic : Automate scaling / Drop in demand
7. Current The underlying hardware and software is upgrade or replace by provider withour interruption to you.

# Types of Cloud Computing
1. SaaS : Software as a Service : run & manage by provider. like Saleforce + Gmail + Office 365 : For Customers
2. PaaS : Platform as a Service : Focus on the deployment & Managment of apps. like AWS + Heroku + Google App Engine : For Developers.
3. IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service :  Basic building block of cloud IT + Provide access to networking feature computer + storage like Azure + AWS + Oracle Cloud : For Admins

# Types of Cloud Computing Responsibilities

# Cloud Deployment Models
1. Public Cloud : Everything built on the cloud provider  + Cloud Native + Everything run on azure.
2. Private Cloud : Everything build on company data center + On-Premise + The cloud could be OpenStack.
3. Hybrid : On-Premise & Cloud Service Provider
4. Cross Cloud : Multiple Cloud Provider

# Cloud Architecture Terminologies
1. Availability  : Remains available
2. Scalability : Grow rapidly 
3. Elasticity : Shrik & grow to meet the demand
4. Fault Tolerance : Prevent a failure
5. Disaster Recovery OR Highly Durable : Recover from a failure


# Hight Availability

# Global Infrastructure

# Regions and Geographies
1. Region : is a grouping of multiple datacenters (Availability Zone) + 58 Region accross 140 Countries.
2. Geograhy : Discreet market of two or more regions that preserves data residency & compliance boundaries.
3. Azure Geographies : USA + Azure Government US + Canada + Barzil + Mexico .i.e you want to guarantee that data will remain within canda.

# Paired Regions
1- One region is paired with another region 300 miles away.
2- Only one region is updated at time .
3- Some Azure Services rely on paried regions for disaster recovery.
4- GRS (azure geo-redundant storage) : replicate data to a secondary region automatically.
5- Example : Canada + Canada Central + Canada East

# Region Types and Service Availability
1. Not all azure services are available in every region
2. Recommended regions : provide broadest range of servies + Design to support Availabity Zone 
3. Alternate regions : region that extends footprint within a data residency boundary where recommended regions also exist + Not support Availabity Zone + label as "Other" in azure portal.
4. General Availability : Service publicy availabil to everyone.

# Azure Cloud Services 
1.  3 Catagories
2.  Foundational : Available immediately or in 12 month in recommended + alternate region in GA.
3.  MainStream : Available immediately or in 12 month in recommended regions + maybe available in alternate region on customer demand.
4.  Specialized : Available in recommended or alternate region based on customer demand.


# Special Regions

# Availability Zones
1. AZ : Physical Location with one or more data-center.
2. DataCenter : Secured that contains hundard of thousand computers. 
3. Region : Generally contain 3 AZ + Datacenter within region are isolated with each other in differnt buildings but they will close engouh to avoid latency.
4. For high availability we run workload in at least 3  AZs.
