# Extra OSI Layers

Physical Layer (Postal Service):

This layer deals with the actual physical aspects of sending a letter, like the paper, envelope, and the postal service's trucks.
Example: The paper and envelope you use to write your letter.

Data Link Layer (Addressing and Packaging):

This layer focuses on how you address and package your letter so that it's clear where it's going and how it's protected.
Example: Writing your friend's address on the envelope and sealing it properly.

Network Layer (Routing):

This layer is like deciding which postal route or courier service to use to get your letter to your friend's city or town.
Example: Choosing the right postal service or courier company based on your friend's location.

Transport Layer (Delivery Assurance):

This layer ensures that your letter arrives intact and, if needed, that you get a confirmation when your friend receives it.
Example: Requesting a delivery confirmation or tracking number.

Session Layer (Establishing Communication):

This layer is about deciding when you and your friend should exchange letters and how often.
Example: Deciding to send letters to each other every Monday.

Presentation Layer (Making It Understandable):

This layer makes sure that the contents of your letter are in a format that your friend can understand, like writing in a language they speak.
Example: Writing your letter in a language your friend understands.

Application Layer (Writing the Letter):

This is where you write the letter and decide what you want to say to your friend.
